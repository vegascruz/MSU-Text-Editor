  ## Why?
  Coding bootcamp project

  "Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline."

  Definitely a useful program for coders/note takers who need a quick and easy way to write a snippet.
